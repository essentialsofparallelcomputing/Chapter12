The installation of OpenCL can be tricky. It is also constantly changing for each vendor. Please check for current instructions for your particular GPU model. The following instructions will give you an idea of the process.

Often the OpenCL installation will be bundled with CUDA on Nvidia devices. Check those CUDA directories first before installing. If not there, then install OpenCL for Nvidia with the virtual package.

sudo apt install ocl-icd-libopencl1 ocl-icd opencl-headers
     or directly install the Nvidia packages
sudo apt ocl-icd-libopencl1 nvidia-opencl-340 nvidia-compute-390

The AMD installation is getting easier with the ROCm suite. To install OpenCL for AMD, you can just install OpenCL with the following or install the full ROCm suite as given in section 12.2.3.

# these don't work in a virtual machine

       sudo apt-get install rocm-opencl-dev
   71  wget -qO - http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
   72  echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
   74  sudo apt update
   75  sudo apt list --upgradable
   76  sudo apt upgrade
   77  sudo apt install rocm-dkms

To check your installation
/opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo
/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/x86_64/clinfo

To get a list of installed components
apt list --installed | grep -i roc

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rocm/bin:/opt/rocm/profiler/bin:/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/x86_64' | 
	sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/rocm.sh

To remove rocm
sudo apt autoremove rocm-dkms rocm-dev rocm-utils

Don't mix amdgpu installs with the rocm installs
  103  tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro-19.50-967956-ubuntu-18.04.tar.xz
  104  cd amdgpu-pro-19.50-967956-ubuntu-18.04/
  105  ls
  106  ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal,legacy
